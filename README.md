I'm a huge fan of the YouTube chanel "The Coding Train" so I decided to test out the p5.js library: https://p5js.org/. In this repository you will find a couple of creative coding projects that i developed with inspiration from The Coding Train. To run any of the projects just open the corresponding html file in your browser.
