In this repository you will find a collection of creative coding projects that i developed with inspiration from The Coding Train. To check out the different projects just open the corresponding "index.html"-file in your browser. 

## Matrix Rain
Under the matrix_rain folder you'll find a sketch with inspiration from the Matrix movies. The program generates symbol rain that results in a cool graphics sequence in the browser.

Under the fireworks folder you'll find, you guessed it, a firework simulation. The program continuously generates fireworks in the browser window.
